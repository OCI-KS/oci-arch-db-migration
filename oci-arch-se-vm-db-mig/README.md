# oci-arch-se-vm-db-mig

This code will help you deploy a compute instance and a Virtual Machine (VM) database system in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

## How this project is organized

The terraform code will deploy a VCN, a 4 OCPU compute instance in a private subnet and a VM database in a separate private subnet.


## Prerequisites

First off we'll need to do some pre deploy setup.  That's all detailed [here](https://github.com/oracle/oci-quickstart-prerequisites).
